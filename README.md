# CaLLaR
CaLLaR is a project by us that aims to detect the emotions of cats by analyzing their meows. 
Only 3 emotions can be detected which is 'Brushing', 'Isolation' and 'Waiting for Food'

We used an open source dataset that can be acquired from here: https://zenodo.org/record/4008297 

This is the first time us handling a machine learning project,therefore, we hope to learn more in the future!
